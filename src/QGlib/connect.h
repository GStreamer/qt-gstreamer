/*! Connects \a detailedSignal of \a instance to the specified \a slot of \a receiver.
 *
 * This method provides a way of connecting GObject signals to C++ slots, in a Qt-like fashion.
 *
 * \a instance needs to be a pointer to a GLib instantiatable type, such as a GObject. You can
 * pass a RefPointer as an argument here without any problems; it will automatically cast to void*.
 *
 * \a detailedSignal should be the name of the signal that you want to conenct to - with an
 * optional detail, if the signal supports details. The signal must \em not use the Qt SIGNAL()
 * macro; it should use the signal canonical form specified in GLib, i.e. it should be a string
 * containing only lowercase letters and dashes. For example, "my-signal" is a valid signal name.
 * The detail may be specified by appending "::" to the signal name and the detail after that.
 * For example, "my-signal::detail".
 *
 * \a receiver should be the instance of the class on which \a slot will be invoked. Currently,
 * the \a receiver needs to inherit QObject. If you use another class that doesn't inherit
 * QObject, a compilation error will occur.
 *
 * \a slot should be a C++ member function pointer that points to the method that you want
 * to be invoked on the \a receiver once the signal is emitted. Note that it must \em not use
 * the Qt SLOT() macro.
 *
 * Special care must be taken with the arguments that \a slot takes. Consider the following
 * example. The C API documentation mentions a signal that takes these parameters:
 * \code
 * void user_function (GObject *object, GParamSpec *pspec, gpointer user_data);
 * \endcode
 * The first argument is always a pointer to the sender object, the second argument is
 * the real signal argument and the third argument is a user defined pointer that is usually
 * used in C as a substitute for the \a receiver. In general, the first argument is always
 * the sender, the 2nd to Nth-1 arguments are the real signal arguments and the Nth argument
 * is a user defined pointer. Now in C++, the following rules apply:
 * \li You must use the C++ equivalent types of the arguments that the signal sends.
 * So, in the above example, GParamSpec* is translated to QGlib::ParamSpecPtr.
 * \li You must not have the user_data argument at the end.
 * \li You must not have the sender argument at the beginning, unless QGlib::PassSender
 * is used in \a flags.
 * \li You may use const references in the arguments to avoid unecessary copying of objects,
 * as the C++ marshaller that will call your slot will always hold a copy of the converted
 * C++ objects.
 *
 * So, the C++ signature should eventually be:
 * \code
 * void MyClass::mySlot(const QGlib::ParamSpecPtr & pspec);
 * ...
 * //Connected with:
 * QGlib::connect(element, "notify::name", myClassInstance, &MyClass::mySlot);
 * \endcode
 * \em or
 * \code
 * void MyClass::mySlot(const QGlib::ObjectPtr & sender, const QGlib::ParamSpecPtr & pspec);
 * ...
 * //Connected with:
 * QGlib::connect(element, "notify::name", myClassInstance, &MyClass::mySlot, QGlib::PassSender);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Internally, the signal provides GValues that are converted to the C++ types that your
 * \a slot specifies using Value::get(), so all rules that apply there also apply to the
 * \a slot arguments. That means that you may actually use different types of arguments
 * than the ones that the documentation specifies, given that Value is able to transform
 * them (see Value::canTransformTo) to the type that you have requested. Obviously, if you
 * specify non-compatible arguments on the \a slot, the conversion will fail, and in this case
 * a warning is printed at the time of the signal emission and the \a slot is not invoked.
 *
 * \note
 * \li Include <QGlib/Connect> to use this function
 * \li Unlike Qt, in GObject some signals are able to return values back to the sender.
 * In this case, your \a slot should specify a compatible return type instead of void.
 * \li This method makes use of C++0x features (namely, variadic templates and rvalue
 * references). If your compiler does not support them, a hacky implementation using boost's
 * preprocessor, function and bind libraries will be compiled instead. That version has a
 * limit of 9 slot arguments.
 * \li This function is thread-safe.
 *
 * \returns whether the connection was successfully made or not

//Fake disconnect() declaration.
//Doxygen should document a version with optional arguments. In reality we have to use
//two versions to avoid having to type the template parameters in case the user wants
//to use NULL for the receiver and slot arguments. Also, a version that takes void*
//for everything is not possible since member function pointers do not cast to void*.

/*! Disconnects \a detailedSignal of \a instance from the \a slot of \a receiver.
 *
 * A signal-slot connection typically is broken when either of the objects involved
 * are destroyed. However, there are cases in which you might want to break that
 * connection manually using this method.
 *
 * disconnect() can be used in the following ways:
 * \li Disconnect everything connected to an object's signals:
 * \code
 * disconnect(myGObject);
 * \endcode
 * \li Disconnect everything connected to a specific signal:
 * \code
 * disconnect(myGObject, "some-signal");
 * \endcode
 * \li Disconnect a specific receiver:
 * \code
 * disconnect(myGObject, 0, myReceiver);
 * \endcode
 * \li Disconnect a specific slot (note that the receiver must also be specified):
 * \code
 * disconnect(myGObject, 0, myReceiver, &MyReceiver::mySlot);
 * \endcode
 *
 * 0 can be used as a wildcard, meaning "any signal", "any receiver" or "any slot".
 * \a instance can never be 0.
 *
 * If \a detailedSignal is 0, it disconnects \a receiver and \a slot from any signal.
 * Otherwise, only \a detailedSignal is disconnected. A signal detail may or may not
 * be specified. If it is not specified, it acts as a wildcard for all details, meaning
 * it disconnects all the connections that have been made with a specific detail.
 *
 * If \a receiver is 0, it disconnects anything connected to \a detailedSignal. If not,
 * only slots in \a receiver are disconnected.
 *
 * If \a slot is 0, it disconnects anything that is connected to \a receiver. If not,
 * only the specified \a slot will be disconnected. Note that \a slot must be 0 if
 * \a receiver is left out.
 *
 * \note
 * \li Include <QGlib/Connect> to use this function
 * \li This function is thread-safe.
