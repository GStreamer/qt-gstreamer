/*! \headerfile videowidget.h <QGst/Ui/VideoWidget>
 * \brief A generic video widget that can embed a video sink
 *
 * This widget allows you to embed a video sink on a Qt user interface.
 *
 * There are two ways of using this widget:
 * \li Create a video sink yourself and set it with the setVideoSink() method.
 * This will work for all sinks that implement the VideoOverlay interface, plus
 * "qtvideosink", "qtglvideosink" and "qwidgetvideosink" (or "qt5videosink",
 * "qt5glvideosink" and "qwidget5videosink" in Qt5), which paint directly
 * on the widget.
 * \li Create a pipeline and let the widget watch the pipeline using the
 * watchPipeline() method. This will cause the widget to watch the bus for
 * the "prepare-window-handle" that all VideoOverlay sinks send right before
 * creating a window and will embed any sink that sends this message.
 * You need to make sure however that there can only be one video sink in
 * this pipeline. If there are more than one, you should handle them yourself
 * and set them with the setVideoSink() method to different widgets.
 *
 * Nearly all the methods of this class \em must be called from Qt's GUI thread.
 * Also, you cannot start or stop watching a pipeline that is in PLAYING state.
 * Doing so may crash the widget.
 *
 * This widget will always keep a strong reference to the element that it is given,
 * whether this is a video sink or a pipeline. If you want to destroy this element
 * or pipeline, you need to call releaseVideoSink() or stopPipelineWatch() respectively.
 *
 * \note Autoplug video sinks such as autovideosink are not supported due
 * to the complexity of handling them correctly. If you wish to use autovideosink,
 * you can either set it to READY state and get its child VideoOverlay element
 * or just watch the pipeline in which you plug it.
